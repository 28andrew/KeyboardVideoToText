# KeyboardVideoToText
*Final project for CPSC 185.*

Fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-Omni-3B model to predict typed text from overhead video (with audio) of typing on a keyboard.

Our keyboard video dataset, with full videos and keystroke timing data, is available at this [HuggingFace dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/andrewt28/keystroke-typing-videos).
